# Anime tracker



## App description
It's a trucker where you can make your own anime list to track which anime you are watching or which you abandoned! Also you can see stats on your watching anime!
## Features

- **Anime list search:** You can easily search your anime list in two ways, by title and status of the anime you are interested in.
- **Anime stats:** If you like statistics and are a fan of charts, you will find something for yourself there. You can observe what type of anime you watch most often and in what category.
- **Easy adding anime:** You can easily add all your favorite anime to the list. The only two things you need to enter are the title and the number of episodes, the rest you can easily choose from the drop-down list.
- **Delete anime from list:** You can also easily delete your added anime with one button when, for example, you make a mistake or when you are not interested in the anime.
